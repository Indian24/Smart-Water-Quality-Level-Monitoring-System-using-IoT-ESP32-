## 📌 Project Summary

The **Smart Water Level & Water Quality Monitoring System** is an IoT-enabled solution designed to **monitor water level in real time**, visualize data on the **Blynk Cloud dashboard**, and trigger **local and cloud-based alerts** using an ESP32 microcontroller.

The system currently focuses on **accurate water level measurement** using an ultrasonic sensor and supports **future extensions for water quality monitoring**, including **pH, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), and turbidity**. It is suitable for **domestic water tanks, industrial reservoirs, smart cities, agriculture, and rural water infrastructure**.
